### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Atria Putri**, a fresh graduate also a data enthusiast,  using this profile to show my data analysis, data visualization, and beginner-level data science portfolio. I took Information Systems concentration while pursuing my Accounting Master's Degree to learn data, so these projects are mainly from assignments or my self-made project. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **SQL, Python, and R** (self-taught)
- âœ¨ Reach me out through my profile: https://linkedin.com/in/atrria


I am learning everyday, so this page will always be updated (and under construction) ðŸš§ as well as my __[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/atrria)__ profile.
