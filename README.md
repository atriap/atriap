### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ this is my Data Portfolio

My name is **Atria Putri**, a fresh graduate also a data enthusiast,  using this profile to show my data analysis, data visualization, and beginner-level data science portfolio. I took Information Systems concentration while pursuing my Accounting Master's Degree to learn data, so these projects are mainly from assignments or my self-made project.
